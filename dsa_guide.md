### Follow this sequence to learn theory then go for problems

> **_Don't follow any roadmaps or sheets; it affects your problem-solving and makes you stick to the same sheet. Instead, learn the concepts first and then go to LeetCode. Select the topic and start with easy questions (5-6), then move on to medium ones (7-8). Keep doing this for every topic. After completing all the topics, do the LeetCode 150 sheet or LeetCode Top Interview 150. or any other list _**
