### Two Pointers Pattern

The Two Pointers pattern is a technique commonly used in solving array and string problems. It involves using two pointers to iterate through the data structure, often from opposite ends, to perform operations like searching, sorting, or modifying elements.

#### How It Works:
1. **Initialization**: Two pointers are initialized, generally at the start and end of the array or string.
2. **Traversal**: The pointers move towards each other based on specific conditions until they meet.
3. **Comparison/Operation**: At each step, the values at the pointers are compared or used for some operation.
4. **Update Pointers**: Depending on the outcome of the comparison, one or both pointers are moved.

#### Diagram:
```
Array: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
Pointers: left -> 1, right -> 6

Step 1: Compare elements at left and right pointers
Step 2: Move pointers towards each other
Step 3: Continue until pointers meet
```

#### Advantages:
- **Efficiency**: Reduces the need for nested loops, leading to O(n) time complexity.
- **Simplicity**: Easy to implement and understand for many problems.
- **Space**: Often requires O(1) additional space, making it memory efficient.

#### Disadvantages:
- **Limited Scope**: Not suitable for all types of problems, particularly those that require more complex data structures.
- **Edge Cases**: Care must be taken to handle edge cases, such as empty arrays or strings.
