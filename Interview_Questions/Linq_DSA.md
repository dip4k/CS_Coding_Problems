### commonly asked interview questions on LINQ, Collections, and inbuilt Data Structures in C#:

**LINQ (Language Integrated Query)**

1. **What is LINQ and why would you use it?**
   
   LINQ is a feature in C# that provides a set of query operators for querying data sources. It can be used to query, filter, and project data in arrays, enumerable classes, XML, relational databases, and third-party data sources.

2. **What is deferred execution in LINQ?**

   Deferred execution means that the evaluation of an expression is delayed until its realized value is actually required. It can greatly improve performance when working with large data sources and complex queries.

3. **Can you explain the difference between `IEnumerable` and `IQueryable` in LINQ?**

   `IEnumerable` is used for querying in-memory collections like arrays, lists, etc., while `IQueryable` is used for querying out-memory (like a database or a web service) data sources.

4. **What are lambda expressions in LINQ? Can you provide an example?**

   Lambda expressions are anonymous functions that can contain expressions and statements. They are used extensively in LINQ queries.

**Collections**

5. **What are the different types of collections in C#?**

   C# includes several collection classes, such as `List<T>`, `Dictionary<TKey, TValue>`, `HashSet<T>`, `Queue<T>`, `Stack<T>`, etc.

6. **What is the difference between a `List<T>` and a `Dictionary<TKey, TValue>`?**

   A `List<T>` is an ordered collection of items that can be accessed by index, while a `Dictionary<TKey, TValue>` is a collection of key-value pairs and provides fast retrieval of values by keys.

7. **What are the advantages and disadvantages of arrays and collections?**

   Arrays are simple and provide fast access to elements, but their size is fixed at the time of creation. Collections, on the other hand, are dynamic and provide several powerful methods for manipulating data, but they can be more complex and slower than arrays.

**Data Structures**

8. **What are some of the built-in data structures in C# and why would you use them?**

   C# includes several built-in data structures, such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, hash sets, and dictionaries. The choice of data structure depends on the specific requirements of the task at hand - for example, arrays for fast access by index, dictionaries for fast lookup by key, queues for first-in-first-out (FIFO) operations, etc.

9. **What is the difference between a stack and a queue?**

   A stack is a last-in-first-out (LIFO) data structure - the last item added is the first one to be removed. A queue is a first-in-first-out (FIFO) data structure - the first item added is the first one to be removed.

10. **Can you explain the difference between a `HashSet<T>` and a `List<T>`?**

   A `HashSet<T>` is a collection of unique elements and provides fast lookup, addition, and removal of items, but it doesn't maintain any order. A `List<T>` is an ordered collection of items and allows duplicates.

19. **How would you use LINQ to find the longest word in a string?**
```csharp
string text = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog";
string longestWord = text.Split(' ').OrderByDescending(w => w.Length).First();
```
This will return the longest word in the string, which is "jumps".

20. **How would you use LINQ to find all strings that start with a certain character in a list of strings?**
```csharp
List<string> words = new List<string> { "apple", "banana", "cherry", "date", "elderberry" };
char startChar = 'b';
var wordsStartingWithB = words.Where(w => w.StartsWith(startChar)).ToList();
```
This will return a new list containing {"banana"}.
