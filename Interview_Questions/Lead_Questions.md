- **How do you balance technical debt and delivery timelines in planning releases?**
  
  *Example follow-up:* 
  - How do you factor in risks when planning sprints or releases?

### 2. **Risk Management**
- **What are the common risks you encounter in .NET and Azure development projects, and how do you mitigate them?**
- **How would you manage a situation where a critical Azure service (e.g., App Service or Service Bus) goes down during a release?**
- **Can you give an example of a time you had to reprioritize due to a technical risk? How did you handle it?**
  
### 3. **Team Coordination & Leadership**
- **How do you handle task assignment within the team, especially when skills and experience levels vary?**
- **How do you ensure that developers are engaged and working efficiently on their tasks?**
- **Can you describe your approach to mentoring junior developers or resolving conflicts within the team?**
- **What’s your process for handling underperformance or bottlenecks in the development team?**
  
  *Example follow-up:*
  - How do you foster collaboration and knowledge-sharing across the team?

### 4. **Release Management**
- **What are the key factors you consider when planning a release in Azure?**
- **How do you coordinate between development and operations teams during the release process?**
- **What tools or processes do you use to ensure smooth CI/CD pipelines, particularly using Azure DevOps?**
  
  *Example follow-up:* 
  - What is your approach to handling post-release bugs or incidents?

### 5. **Azure Expertise**
- **How would you design a scalable .NET application architecture using Azure services (e.g., App Service, Service Bus, Azure Functions)?**
- **How do you monitor and troubleshoot issues in Azure, particularly related to performance bottlenecks?**
- **Can you explain how you’d implement an end-to-end deployment pipeline in Azure DevOps for a .NET Core application?**

### 6. **Communication & Collaboration with PM/Scrum Master**
- **How do you work with PMs or Scrum Masters to prioritize backlog items in an Agile environment?**
- **How do you ensure that project goals align with the technical feasibility of the development team?**
- **What’s your approach to managing scope creep in a development cycle?**
  
### 7. **Scenario-Based Questions**
- **You’ve planned a release, but the client requests a last-minute feature. How would you handle this situation?**
- **If the team identifies a critical performance issue late in the development cycle, how would you reprioritize tasks or adjust the release plan?**

### Technical-Leadership Hybrid Questions:
- **Can you provide an example of a particularly challenging .NET project where you had to coordinate tasks, manage risks, and deliver on time?**
- **How do you ensure your team is keeping up with the latest best practices in .NET and Azure development?**
