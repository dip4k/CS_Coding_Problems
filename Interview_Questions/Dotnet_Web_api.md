# .Net Core Web API Interview Questions

1. **What is REST?**
   REST stands for Representational State Transfer. It is an architectural style for distributed hypermedia systems and was first presented by Roy Fielding in 2000 in his famous dissertation.

2. **What are the principles of REST?**
   The six guiding principles of REST include client-server, stateless, cacheable, uniform interface, layered system, and code on demand.

3. **What is a RESTful Web API?**
   A RESTful API is an application program interface (API) that uses HTTP requests to GET, PUT, POST and DELETE data. 

4. **What is .Net Core Web API?**
   .Net Core Web API is a framework for building HTTP services that can be accessed from any client including browsers and mobile devices. It is an ideal platform for building RESTful applications on the .NET Core.

5. **What are the HTTP Verbs used in REST?**
   The common HTTP verbs used in REST include GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, HEAD, OPTIONS and PATCH.

6. **What is the use of each HTTP Verb in REST?**
   - GET: Retrieves resources
   - POST: Creates resources
   - PUT: Updates existing resources
   - DELETE: Deletes resources
   - HEAD: Similar to GET but without the response body
   - OPTIONS: Describes the communication options for the target resource
   - PATCH: Apply partial modifications to a resource

7. **What is routing in .Net Core Web API?**
   Routing is a pattern matching system that monitors the incoming request and figures out what to do with that request. At runtime, Routing engine uses the Route table for matching the incoming request's URL pattern against the URL patterns defined in the Route table.

8. **What are the types of routing in .Net Core Web API?**
   There are two types of routing in .Net Core Web API: Convention-based routing and Attribute routing.

9. **What is the difference between Convention-based routing and Attribute routing?**
   In Convention-based routing, you define a route table at the application startup which the framework will use to match incoming request. In Attribute routing, you apply attributes to the controller and actions to define the routes.

10. **What is the status code returned for successful GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE operations in RESTful Web API?**
   - GET: 200 (OK)
   - POST: 201 (Created)
   - PUT: 200 (OK)
   - DELETE: 204 (No Content)

11. **What is the difference between PUT and PATCH requests?**
   PUT is used to update the entire resource with the complete new version. PATCH, on the other hand, is used to update partial changes to the resource.

12. **What is REST specification?**
   There is no official REST specification. REST is a style of software architecture. As such, it doesn't have a specification like SOAP or HTTP. However, most RESTful implementations make use of standards such as HTTP, URI, JSON, and XML.

# Additional .Net Core Web API Interview Questions

13. **What is the use of the Accept and Content-Type Headers in HTTP Request?**
   - `Accept` header is used by HTTP clients to tell the server what content types they'll accept. The server will then send back a response, which will include a Content-Type header telling the client what the content type of the returned content actually is.
   - `Content-Type` header is used to indicate the media type of the resource in the response or the media type of the request body in POST or PUT requests.

14. **What is OData in Web API?**
   OData (Open Data Protocol) is an OASIS standard that defines the best practice for building and consuming RESTful APIs. It allows clients to request and manipulate data using standard HTTP protocols.

15. **What is Swagger in .Net Core Web API?**
   Swagger is a set of open-source tools built around the OpenAPI Specification that can help you design, build, document and consume REST APIs.

16. **What is the purpose of IActionResult return type in .Net Core Web API?**
   IActionResult allows you to return a custom response from your action methods in the API Controllers. It provides several helper methods to generate standard HTTP response like Ok(), BadRequest(), NotFound() etc.

17. **What is the difference between 200 OK and 201 Created HTTP status codes?**
   - `200 OK` is the standard response for successful HTTP requests. When received in response to a GET command, it indicates that the request was successful and the requested information is in the response.
   - `201 Created` status code indicates that the request has been fulfilled and has resulted in one or more new resources being created.

18. **What is CORS and how is it handled in .Net Core Web API?**
   CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is a mechanism that allows many resources (e.g., fonts, JavaScript, etc.) on a web page to be requested from another domain outside the domain from which the resource originated. In .Net Core Web API, CORS is handled by adding CORS Middleware to the HTTP pipeline using the `UseCors` method.

19. **What is Middleware in .Net Core Web API?**
   Middleware is software that's assembled into an app pipeline to handle requests and responses. Each component in the Middleware pipeline is responsible for invoking the next component in the pipeline or short-circuiting the pipeline.

20. **What is Dependency Injection in .Net Core Web API?**
   Dependency Injection (DI) is a design pattern used to implement IoC (Inversion of Control). It allows the creation of dependent objects outside of a class and provides those objects to a class through different ways.

# Further .Net Core Web API Interview Questions

21. **What is the use of the [FromBody] and [FromUri] attributes in Web API?**
   - `[FromBody]` attribute is used to bind the parameter from request body. This is often used in POST or PUT requests where the request body contains a JSON object.
   - `[FromUri]` attribute is used to bind the parameter from the request URI. This is often used in GET requests where the parameters are passed in the URL.

22. **What is API Versioning and how it's done in .Net Core Web API?**
   API Versioning gives you a way to make changes to your API without breaking the contract your clients have come to expect. In .Net Core Web API, this can be done using query string, URL path, or HTTP headers.

23. **What is the role of the `Startup.cs` file in .Net Core Web API?**
   The `Startup.cs` file is the entry point for an application. It's responsible for starting the application and it's also the place where you can configure services needed by your application.

24. **What is the difference between AddSingleton, AddScoped and AddTransient in .Net Core?**
   - `AddSingleton`: Creates a single instance of the service for the entire application and reuses that instance every time this particular service is requested.
   - `AddScoped`: Creates a single instance of the service for each request scope. This means that every unique request will have its own instance of a service, but if within that request the service is required again, the same instance will be used.
   - `AddTransient`: Creates a new instance of the service every time a service is requested.

25. **What is the use of UseRouting, UseEndpoints, UseAuthentication and UseAuthorization in .Net Core Web API?**
   - `UseRouting`: This is a middleware that matches an incoming HTTP request to a route.
   - `UseEndpoints`: This is a middleware that executes the delegate associated with the selected route.
   - `UseAuthentication`: This is a middleware that enables authentication capabilities.
   - `UseAuthorization`: This is a middleware that enables authorization capabilities.

26. **What is Data Transfer Object (DTO) in Web API?**
   A Data Transfer Object (DTO) is an object that carries data between processes. In the context of a Web API, a DTO is an object that defines how the data will be sent over the network.

27. **What is the difference between IActionResult and ActionResult in .Net Core Web API?**
   `IActionResult` represents a generic contract for ActionResult types. `ActionResult<T>` is a type added in ASP.NET Core 2.1 that enables you to specify the type of data included in the action result, allowing better testability of MVC actions.

28. **What are Filters in .Net Core Web API?**
   Filters in .Net Core Web API are used to run code before or after specific stages in the request processing pipeline.

29. **What is model validation in .Net Core Web API?**
   Model validation in .Net Core Web API is the process of ensuring that the data sent to the API action methods matches the expected format and constraints, in order to prevent invalid or harmful data from being processed by the application.

30. **What is Exception Handling Middleware in .Net Core Web API?**
   Exception Handling Middleware is a component in .Net Core Web API that catches any unhandled exceptions thrown during the processing of HTTP requests, and returns a formatted HTTP response.
   
# More .Net Core Web API Interview Questions

31. **What is the purpose of the `ConfigureServices` method in the `Startup.cs` file?**
   The `ConfigureServices` method is used to add and configure services. Services are components that are used by the app to perform various tasks like database interaction, caching, logging, etc.

32. **What is the purpose of the `Configure` method in the `Startup.cs` file?**
   The `Configure` method is used to specify how the app responds to HTTP requests. The request pipeline is configured by adding middleware components to an `IApplicationBuilder` instance.

33. **What are the differences between .NET Core Web API and .NET Framework Web API?**
   The main differences include the fact that .NET Core is cross-platform, supports side-by-side versioning, and doesn't require a hosting server, unlike .NET Framework.

34. **What is JWT and how is it used in .Net Core Web API for authentication?**
   JWT (JSON Web Token) is a compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties. In .Net Core Web API, JWT can be used for authentication by sending a token on each request to authenticate the user.

35. **What is the difference between `appsettings.json` and `secrets.json` in .Net Core Web API?**
   `appsettings.json` is the default configuration file used in .Net Core apps. `secrets.json` is a separate file where you can store sensitive data, like connection strings, API keys, etc., that you don't want to include in your source code.

36. **What is the role of the `Program.cs` file in .Net Core Web API?**
   `Program.cs` is the entry point of a .Net Core application. It typically contains the `Main` method, which is the entry point of the application and is responsible for creating the host where the application will run.

37. **What is the `wwwroot` folder in .Net Core Web API?**
   The `wwwroot` folder is the root directory of the web server, which means that static files like HTML, CSS, images, and JavaScript files should be placed within this folder.

38. **What is the purpose of `UseStaticFiles` in .Net Core Web API?**
   `UseStaticFiles` is a middleware that enables the application to serve static files.

39. **What are environment variables in .Net Core Web API and how are they used?**
   Environment variables are a way of passing configuration information to applications. In .Net Core Web API, they can be used to set environment-specific settings that are read by the application at runtime.

40. **What is the difference between `Host` and `WebHost` in .Net Core Web API?**
   `WebHost` is specific to ASP.NET Core applications, whereas `Host` is a more general concept that can be used with any .NET Core application. `Host` also has support for dependency injection, configuration, and logging out of the box.
   
# REST and .Net Core Web API Interview Questions

41. **What is the Richardson Maturity Model in REST?**
   The Richardson Maturity Model is a way to grade your API according to the constraints of the REST. The model identifies three levels of API maturity: Level 0 (uses one URI and one HTTP method), Level 1 (uses many URIs), Level 2 (uses HTTP methods), Level 3 (uses HATEOAS).

42. **What is HATEOAS in REST?**
   HATEOAS (Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State) is a principle of REST. It means that the API should guide the client through the application by returning relevant information about the next potential steps, along with each response.

43. **What is OAuth in Web API?**
   OAuth (Open Authorization) is an open standard for token-based authentication and authorization. It allows an end user's account information to be used by third-party services, such as Facebook, without exposing the user's password.

44. **How do you secure a .Net Core Web API?**
   .Net Core Web API can be secured using various mechanisms like JWT (JSON Web Tokens), OAuth, or by using middleware for authentication and authorization. It can also be secured by enforcing HTTPS and using tools like IdentityServer.

45. **What is Caching in Web API?**
   Caching is a technique of storing frequently used data/information in memory, so that, when the same data/information is needed next time, it could be directly retrieved from the memory instead of being generated by the application. Caching improves the performance and scalability of the application.

46. **How do you handle errors in .Net Core Web API?**
   Errors in .Net Core Web API can be handled by using middleware, by implementing exception filters, or by using the `TryCatch` block.

47. **What is the difference between 4xx and 5xx HTTP status codes?**
   4xx status codes are client error responses, indicating that the request contains bad syntax or cannot be fulfilled. 5xx status codes are server error responses, indicating that the server failed to fulfill a valid request.

48. **What is the role of the `Authorize` attribute in .Net Core Web API?**
   The `Authorize` attribute is used to specify that a controller or a controller action can be accessed only by authenticated users or users with specific roles.

49. **What is rate limiting in Web API?**
   Rate limiting is a technique for limiting network traffic. It sets a limit on how many requests a client can make to the API within a certain time period.

50. **What is API Throttling?**
   API throttling is the process of limiting the number of requests to an API to prevent it from being overwhelmed by too many requests. It is a part of API management and is used to control the usage of APIs by clients.

# Additional REST and RESTful Web API Services Questions

41. **What is the Richardson Maturity Model in REST?**
   The Richardson Maturity Model is a way to gauge the level of maturity of a RESTful API. It breaks down the principal elements of a REST approach into three steps - Resources, HTTP Verbs, and Hypermedia Controls. These steps are then used to classify a given API according to its level of "RESTfulness".

42. **How does caching work in a RESTful Web API?**
   Caching in RESTful Web API can be implemented using HTTP cache headers (like ETag and Last-Modified). The server includes these headers in the response to indicate how long the client should cache the resource. On subsequent requests, the client can include these headers to tell the server to return the cached resource if it hasn't changed.

43. **What is HATEOAS in REST?**
   HATEOAS (Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State) is a constraint of the REST application architecture. It means that the API should guide the client through the application by providing relevant information within the responses, in the form of hypermedia links.

44. **What is the role of a RESTful Web API mediator?**
   A RESTful Web API mediator acts as an intermediary between the client and the resources. The mediator processes incoming requests, routes them to the appropriate resource, and returns the resource's response to the client.

45. **What is Idempotency in REST?**
   Idempotency in REST means that multiple identical requests should have the same effect as a single request. The HTTP methods GET, PUT, DELETE, HEAD, OPTIONS and TRACE are idempotent, while POST is not.

46. **What is the role of URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) in REST?**
   In REST, a URI is a way of identifying a specific resource. The client uses this URI to access the resource. A well-designed RESTful URI should be self-descriptive, intuitive, and hierarchical.

47. **What are status codes in RESTful Web API?**
   Status codes are part of the HTTP/1.1 specification and are divided into five classes. They inform the client about the result of the request. For example, a 200 status code means 'OK', a 404 status code means 'Not Found', etc.

48. **What is content negotiation in RESTful Web API?**
   Content negotiation is the process of selecting the best representation for a given response when there are multiple representations available. This can be done by the server using the `Accept` header provided by the client in the HTTP request.

49. **What is the difference between SOAP and RESTful Web API?**
   SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) is a protocol which was designed before REST and came into the picture. The main difference between them is that SOAP is a protocol and REST is an architectural style. Another notable difference is that SOAP uses XML for message format, while REST is not limited to XML; it can return XML, JSON, YAML, or any other format depending on what the client requests.

50. **What is OAuth and how it's used in RESTful Web API?**
   OAuth (Open Authorization) is an open standard for token-based authentication and authorization. In a RESTful Web API, OAuth allows an application to access the API on behalf of a user without requiring the user to disclose their credentials.
